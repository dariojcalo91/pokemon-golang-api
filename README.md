# Pokemon API Service
For golang practice.

This pet project is related to the practice of:
- Golang basics
- Hexagonal architecture
- CI/CD
- Unit testing

# TODO List / Next steps

- Unit testing and e2e
- CI/CD (Github actions maybe)
- Refactor: involve requests into gorutines so requests to repos become faster.
- Complete mapping of all known Pokemon types.
- Add a new endpoint for writing into a db so the service can handle a new repo (still diving into hexagonal architecture)

# Extra notes
Comments/code reviews/recommendations are welcome.
